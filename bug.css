The CSS property `calc()` is used incorrectly, resulting in unexpected layout or rendering issues. For instance, using `calc(100% - 10px)` within a flexbox context might not subtract the 10px as expected, leading to elements overflowing their container or not aligning properly.  Another example is incorrect unit usage within `calc()`, mixing percentages and pixels without proper consideration of context.  Sometimes, a missing space between operators and values (`calc(100%-10px)` instead of `calc(100% - 10px)`) may cause unexpected behavior.
